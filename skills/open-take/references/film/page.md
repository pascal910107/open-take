## The page

A film is a page that knows its length:

```js
window.__film = { duration: 42.5, audio: "score.wav" }; // audio: optional, relative to the page
```

Then either:

- **draw any moment on request** — `window.__render = (t) => { … }` (t in
  seconds, called in any order; may return a promise). The page is a pure
  function of time, which makes every frame reproducible and lets a section be
  re-rendered alone; or
- **just animate** — CSS animations and transitions, the Web Animations API,
  `requestAnimationFrame` loops, GSAP, three.js, `<video>`. The renderer puts
  every clock the page can read on film time (`performance.now`, `Date`,
  timers, rAF), pauses every animation and video and sets it to the exact
  frame. Such a page keeps its own state, so it is played front to back.
  `requestAnimationFrame` runs 60 times a second of film time, as on a 60 Hz
  screen, so what it moves is drawn sharp; motion blur falls on what CSS, the
  Web Animations API or `__render` move.

`Math.random` is seeded (every render draws the same numbers). The page lays
out at 1920×1080 CSS px unless `__film` says `width`/`height` (a vertical cut:
1080×1920). `__film.ready` (a promise) holds the first frame until your assets
are in; fonts and images are awaited anyway.
